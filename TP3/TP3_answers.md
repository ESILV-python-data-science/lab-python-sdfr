Select the is best value for k according to the accuracy on the dev set. Report the performance performance of the classifier on the test set for this value of k.
> The best value of k on the valid set is 3: Accuracy score on the VALID set = 0.92775 / Accuracy score on the TEST set = 0.924666666667

Train a Logistic Regression classifier on 80% and test on 20% of the samples. Report the accuracy and compare to the best result of the kNN classifier.
> The best result of the kNN classifier (0.924666666667) is better than the result of the logistic regression classifier (0.859583333333)
